# Code-Refactoring

This is an exercise in refactoring existing codebase.

Webside need to be accessibility to all who visit.

I set out to modify the code in such a way that it does not change the display but still contains the semantic tags necessary to convey the structure.

I did this by adding html tags, inserting attributes & uploading the related CSS & fixing some bugs.

This assignment helped me to be more thoughtful to design web pages.
